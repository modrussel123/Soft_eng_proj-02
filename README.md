Update:
As per our group discussion during the meeting, we adopted a user-friendly UI/UX design to enhance accessibility, usability, and overall user experience while maintaining backend compatibility. The UI/UX developer redesigned the original design of Main Lead Developer interfaces, improving the layout, navigation, and overall aesthetics to make the system more intuitive and visually appealing.

Additionally, the lead developer refined the structural design to ensure that the frontend elements seamlessly interact with the backend, optimizing performance and maintaining functionality.
